I am Jeffery Sill, passionate about blockchain technology. I have been studying and learning about it non-stop for over a year now and have become immersed in the environment by browsing Twitter, various Discord channels, and researching every day.

I am currently a mod on a couple NFT projects for their Discords, I have made friends and future business partners whom I work with on a daily basis, researching opportunities and various investments. 

I have a side job where I do web design/development and SEO for a couple large companies. I am also a landlord and own property. My biggest passion is for the blockchain, crypto, NFT's, and crypto gaming. This technology will change the world and every industry in it.
